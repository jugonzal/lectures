Hi all, this morning we had a really good session writing good, useful functions.
In particular functions that helped me manage my Tweeps.  I like that we explored
many different challenges and solved them all with functions, always trying to 
write better code.

A few things that I should've mentioned while talking about functions:

- In *javascript*, functions are "first class citizens". For example we can put them in variables.
- Variables declared within a function only exist within that function. Be mindful of functions that use variables without declaring as they may be stepping on existing variables unintentionally.
- A function should do ONE thing and one thing alone.  This is why we decomposed many little actions into their own little functions.
- Perhaps the most important trick we learned was that a function can be passed as a parameter to another function. This is what we call a "callback"

You can find all of the code we wrote in [my github repo](https://github.com/jugonzal/lhl-lectures/blob/master/w1d4-callbacks/tweeps.js)
